### Part I: Consuming Twitter API

Use the [ Twitter API ]( https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation ) to
fill the following areas on the page:

- The 30 most recent tweets from @Trizic
- The 30 most recent tweets from @laughingsquid.
- The 30 most recent tweets from @techcrunch.

Each tweet should include at minimum:

- The tweet content
- A well-formatted `created_at` date
- A link to the tweet.
- For retweets and mentions, the username should be included.
- Make the columns flexible for screen width so the columns
fill 100% of the page width. Layout could be as small as 320px wide. Column
arrangment is open-ended.


### Part II: Edit layout

Make an "edit layout" view that has a form to change the layout settings.

Use HTML5 LocalStorage to store and load the layout settings.

Configurable settings could possibly include:

- The order of the columns.
- The time range of the tweets shown.
- The number of tweets shown in each column.
- The overall palette/skin of the page.
